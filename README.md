#Chapter One
##First things first

Hi, this is just a note to say you can more or less ignore this repository. I'm just a student learning Ruby on Rails with the [Rails tutorial online book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). 

I'm storing all the work from the chapters on Github for my own benefit, but if someone find it useful to look at that's great too.
